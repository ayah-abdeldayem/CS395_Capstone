# CS395_Capstone

Registered app governance — an audit framework to review OAuth applications and administrative consent for security and compliance.

## Project scope and goals

- **Focus:** Audit and govern registered OAuth applications and admin consent in enterprise environments.

- **In scope:**
  - Discovery and inventory of registered OAuth applications
  - Evaluation of admin consent and permissions granted to applications
  - Risk classification and recommended remediation steps
  - Documentation and example checks to support audits

- **Out of scope (for now):**
  - Building a full user-facing web app or dashboard beyond lightweight reporting
  - Automatic enforcement or policy-based blocking (may be added later)
  - Integrations with unrelated third-party SaaS providers unless required for audits

- **Success criteria:**
  - Clear written scope and goals for the audit framework
  - Sample checks and documentation that enable reproducible audits
  - A small, testable codebase with CI for future automation
